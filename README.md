# IS300-Sidemarkers
Stencil to cut USDM IS300 fenders to install JDM OE Sidemarkers

Printable Stencil (.PDF) available in <a href=/releases>Releases</a>. 

Test print (designed for US Letter paper size) and adjust print settings or stencil accordingly. The stencil front is for the driver's (left) side. Align the right edge of the paper with the fender, and the bottom edge of the paper. Flip for passenger side.

I am not responsible if you mess your fenders up! Measure twice, cut once, and maybe this stencil will help.
